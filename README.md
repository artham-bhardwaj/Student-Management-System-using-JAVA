# Student Management System

## Problem Statement
The **Student Management System** is designed to efficiently manage student records. The application provides functionalities to add new student records, display all records, find the student with the highest marks, calculate the average marks, and delete records based on student ID.

## Objectives
- Implement a system to manage student records.
- Provide functionality to add, display, and manage student data.
- Calculate and display statistics such as highest marks and average marks.
- Use object-oriented principles to design and organize the code.

## Approach
1. **Data Structure**: Utilizes an `ArrayList` to store and manage student records dynamically.
2. **Object-Oriented Design**: The `Student` class encapsulates student details and operations, promoting modularity and maintainability.
3. **Menu-Driven Interface**: Offers a text-based menu for user interactions to perform various operations on the student records.

The code for this project is available in the `code.java` file within this repository.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
 --bash [ git clone https://github.com/yourusername/student-management-system.git](https://github.com/artham-bhardwaj/Student-Management-System-using-JAVA.git)
